
Customized will_paginate plugin to work with the Padrino framework.

- also some features where added:

  + support for rendering the last page
    Product.paginate :page => :last, :per_page => 50
    Product.paginate :page => 'last', :per_page => 50    
      
  + no empty page unless all pages are empty, specially useful if you have more than one
    page and the last element of the last page is removed.

    Product.paginate :page => 10, :per_page => 50 # returns page 4 if page 4 is the last
  
  + no error if rubish page (e.g. '&page=abc'), rubish is replaced by 1 ('&page=last' is the
    exception).
  
  + another link renderer with format '1 - 10 | 11 - 20 | 21 - 30'
  
  + support for html anchor in the pagination links  
    @comments.html_anchor = 'comments' (generates links ending with '#comments')
